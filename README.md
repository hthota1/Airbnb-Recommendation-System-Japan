# Business Problem
Airbnb aims to enhance its presence in Japan by identifying popular properties in Tokyo and expanding its business to other cities outside the capital. Airbnb wants to understand the key factors that contribute to the popularity of properties in Tokyo. These were assessed based on price per night, amenities offered, and user ratings. 

Develop a recommendation system to guide new users in rating properties and receive tailored recommendations based on their preferences.

# Data Overview
